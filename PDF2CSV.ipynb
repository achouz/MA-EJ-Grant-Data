    "In this notebook, we will experiment with multiple methods to extract grants information, particularly those relased in tabular format, from pdfs and websites. We will start with grants information that can be extracted using open-source library first, and then advancing to **Adobe's proprietary API** when open-source library fails. We will also use **RPA** to programatically download the dataset from goverment website with built-in GIS tools and export function for the best result.\n",

    "We can obtain the HTML from the **TURI Grant** website and use human-defined phrasing rules to separate the content into `project`, `town name`, `description`, `amount`, and `year` columns. But I opted for the same ChatGPT approach here since it can perform the cleanning process and Name Entity Recongition to extract the location at the same time.\n",

    "Please note that the TURI grant only publishes the total funds awarded to multiple awardees within a single year, so it is not possible to determine the specific grant amount for each project. One approach is to assume the grant is equally distributed among grantees each year; while this may not be precise, it ensures the total grant amount is not duplicated. We will add a sentence in the description to clarify this approach."
