"Feasibility cost/benefit analysis of SWMI minimization, mitigation, and offsets",Medway,"$99,197 ","Feasibility cost/benefit analysis of SWMI minimization, mitigation and offsetsThis report describes how Medway���s water, sewer and stormwater systems could be upgraded and
meet SWMI requirements under the Water Management Act. The report summarizes all potential
SWMI options the town could take, and rates them as poor, fair or good. The town is close to pumping
its baseline volume and is anticipating needing additional water for industrial and/or commercial
development. Demand management, wastewater, and stormwater offsets are expected to mitigate the
increase.
The town has four gravel���packed wells in the Charles River basin, two on the mainstem and two on a
tributary. Increased pumping capacity and SWMI optimization/minimization requirements could be
achieved by increasing pumping from a well on the Charles River mainstem if its capacity is restored
through refurbishment, satellite wells and/or a replacement well. Pumping more from the mainstem
and less from tributaries could be considered opthe report includes a seasonal pumping
schedule to shift summertime withdrawalsm the tributary to the mainstem.
Medway���s Unaccounted for Water is above the standard of 10%. A water audit may identify
opportunities for saving water, and conservation giveaway programs (aerators, showerheads, rain
barrels, etc.) may reduce residential demand. The report also recommends that the town initiate nonresidential
demand management and to retrofit public buildings with low���flow fixtures. The town has
had outdoor water use restrictions for years and as a result their Residential Gallons per Capita Day
(RGPCD) is below the stand of 65 gallons. Recently installed radio���read meters resulted in a drop in
RGPCD due to more accurate measurements.
The report also recommends that the town continue implementing its existing NPDES MS4 stormwater
requirements, proceed with the Phase II IWRMP stormwater and wastewater needs and capital cost
analyses, and continue discussions about creati",2013.0,"['Charles River', 'Charles River', 'Residential Gallons', 'NPDES MS4']","(42.4072107, -71.3824374)",42.4072107,-71.3824374
Develop supply management protocol,Kingston,"$74,000 ","Develop supply management protocolThe Town of Kingston has two pressure zones, a high pressure zone supplied solely by the Trackle Pond
well and a low pressure zone supplied by five other wells. Due to their proximity to the Jones River, the
low pressure zone wells are more likely to impact streamflow than pumping the Trackle Pond well.
Therefore, it would appear to be environmentally beneficial to shift pumping from the low pressure
zone wells to the Trackle Pond well during low streamflow periods (i.e. summertime).
Elevated manganese in the Trackle Pond well has limited its use to about 0.3 MGD, significantly less than
its approved rate of 1.44 MGD. A manganese removal treatment plant (now under construction) will
allow increased pumping of the Trackle Pond well, which in turn will allow the transfer of water from the
high pressure zone to the low pressure zone. Water from the high pressure zone may need to be dechlorinated
before it enters the low pressure zone water.
A hydraulic model of Kingston���ing and distribution system simulad several pumping scenarios
to evaluate the hydraulic and water quality effects of transferring water from the high pressure zone to
the low pressure zone. Infrastructure modifications may be required such as installing a flow control
valve, de���chlorinating high pressure zone water and removing a booster pump. A supply management
protocol gives priority to transferring water from the high zone to the low zone from May through
October. This could reduce the pumping of the low zone wells by as much as 1 MGD from the rate of
recent years, thus reducing the potential impacts of pumping on the Jones River during seasonally lowstreamflow

Well Pumping and Recharge Strategies for Streamflow Augmentation,Franklin,"$75,000 ","Well Pumping and Recharge Strategies for Streamflow AugmentationThe Town of Franklin is entirely supplied by its ten wells in the Charles River basin, nine on tributaries
and one on the mainstem. This study examined pumping optimization scenarios to reduce streamflow
impacts and operating costs. These scenarios included using only the existing infrastructure, adding a
new well and hypothetically transferring surface water across subbasins during periods of high flow to
recharge groundwater. The study also evaluated site���specific options for infiltrating stormwater to
augment streamflow and reduce phosphorous TMDLs.
The USGS stream deplete (StrmDepl) model was used to simulate the lag time of pumping impacts on
streamflow, taking into account aquifer characteristics, distance from wells to streams, and monthly
pumping rates. The StrmDepl simulations indicate that changing the pumping schedule of existing wells
could results in streamflow improvements (i.e. decrease the percent alteration of August stre)
while at the same time reducing energy costs. The StrmDepl moding also indicates a new well could
further reduce streamflow impacts and energy costs. The town is in the initial stages of assessing the
feasibility of a new well.
Optimization using storage structures and/or increased conservation could also reduce August
streamflow impacts, although storage structures are expensive and most likely not cost���effective.
Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) could be used to pump water from the Charles River to upgradient
aquifers during periods of high streamflow. This would reduce the impact on August streamflow, but
high cost and uncertain permitting would likely prohibit this option in the foreseeable future.
Five candidate locations in Franklin were identified for stormwater retrofit structures that would allow
infiltration of 18 total acres of impervious surface. The infiltration would increase the baseflow of the
streams of their respective subbasins, thus potentially reducing the relative impact of p on
streamflow. The stormwater recharge structures could infiltre 14 million gallons of stormwater

small portion of the town of Hadley. The study assesses design upgrades to the WWTF in anticipation of
more stringent NPDES requirements with a focus on improving environmental sustainability through
wastewater reuse, energy efficiency, alternative energy and sustainable design.
Treatment process alternatives were evaluated for their ability to meet both regulatory requirements
and end user water quality requirements for wastewater reuse, particularly at UMass. Upgrade
alternatives include the ability to remove nitrogen to 8, 5 and 3 mg/L.

Stormwater recharge and infiltration planning,Hopkinton,"$58,989 ","Stormwater recharge and infiltration planningThe Town of Hopkinton is expecting to seek an increase in its Water Management Act authorized
withdrawal from the Concord River basin to meet anticipated growth. This study identified potential
locations in Hopkinton for stormwater recharge, which under SWMI is one option for offsetting
increased withdrawals.
A GIS site���screening analysis was used to identify candidate locations for stormwater recharge
infrastructure, considering the following variables: depth to water; soil permeability; aquifer
transmissivity; sensitive environmental receptors; proximity to wetlands; proximity to Zone IIs; HUC���14
subbasin water mass balance and; land ownership. In GIS the entire town was divided into 35 x 35

Annual total runoff depth was estimated using the SIMPLE and TR���55 methodologies, utilizing 42 years
of precipitation data from the Worcester airport. The annual total precipitation depth was multiplied by
the impervious surface area at each site to estimate the potential annual capacity of stormwater BMPs.
The GIS analysis and field visits identified several candidate sites for constructing stormwater recharge
infrastructure. Town���owned parcels were given high ranking for constructing stormwater BMPs.

Stormwater recharge siting study,Pembroke,"$54,980 ","Stormwater recharge siting studyPembroke���s increase in its Water Management Act permitted withdrawal will require minimization
and/or mitigation. One mitigation option is to increase stormwater infiltration to the aquifer from
which Pembroke withdraws groundwater. This study identified potential sites for stormwater recharge,
predicted the impacts of infiltration using numerical groundwater modeling, and provided the town with
a strategy for implementing SWMI requirements.
Pembroke is supplied entirely by groundwater sources, but is in an aquifer that contains other PWS
supply wells and Great Sandy Bottom Pond, a surface water supply for the Abington/Rockland Joint
Water Works. In 2004 a DEP���sponsored USGS regional groundwater flow model simulated the impact of
these water supply withdrawals on surface water and ground water. The stormwater recharge volumes
identified in this study were added to the USGS groundwater flow model values to simulate the effects
of stormwater infiltration.
GIS infodeveloped to identify sites wherfiltration of stormwater to the aquifer from
impervious surface were most viable, based on hydrogeologic, environmental and wetland criteria. The
study identified 98 sites (14 commercial/industrial parcels, 43 municipal parcels, and 39 existing
stormwater catchments) that are good candidates for stormwater BMPs. The 98 sites were ranked in
order of preference based on the rate of recharge capture. In addition, potential stormwater infiltration
from all residential impervious cover in the study area was estimated to be as much as 450,000 gallons
per day, more than twice the rate from the 98 individual sites. The study included a matrix of 17
stormwater BMPs with their descriptions and unit costs.
Groundwater modeling indicates that the stormwater infiltration would allow higher pumping rates
because of the additional water added to the aquifer. Particle tracking in the numerical model
determined that there would be at least a 1���year travel time from each of the 98 potentcharge

Coastal watershed. Reservoir Dam Pond is upstream of Old Oaken bucket Pond, and the watershed of
these two ponds includes a herring run. The level of Reservoir Dam Pond influences the availability of
water for herring passage and for water supply. This study assessed options for improving seasonal
herring fish passage by raising the level of Reservoir Dam Pond.
Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) modeling of reservoir operations for water supply and
environmental flow releases was done for five Reservoir Dam Pond elevations. A stage���storage curve
was created for Reservoir Dam Pond and a stage���discharge curve was created for its spillway. The WEAP
modeling indicates that multiple scenarios are feasible that will allow spring and fall fish migration while
minimizing the number of days of outdoor water bans.
Cost e WEAP modeling were done for various spillway and fishway modifications necessary

properties around the pond, including homes and septic systems. Higher pond levels would result in
greater impacts to property and thus higher cost to implement. The study concluded that the most

Water Supply Management and Demand Management Plans,Groton,"$66,800 ","This project developed of a Supply Management Protocol/Optimization Plan and a Demand Management
Plan for the town. The Supply Management Protocol/Optimization Plan allowed the town to assess how to
preferentially pump its wells (existing and pending) for the benefit of drinking water supply and the
environment. Modifying the traditional operating protocol and setting the Baddacook Pond Well as first on
and first off and the Whitney Pond Well #1 or Whitney Pond Well #2 as second on and second off, would
allow the Baddacook Pond Well to operate less. This control strategy would allow the town to maximize use
of the Baddacook Pond Well, while staying under the registered authorized withdrawal limit and staying
within the permitted authorized withdrawal limits for the Whitney Pond Wells. The Demand Management
Plan identified those efforts the GWD has already implemented and investigated additional water
conservation efforts that the Town may wish to consider in order to reduce the overall volume to be mitigated
under SWMI. These efforts included the implementation of higher conservation rates for all second/irrigation
meters in Town. There are approximately 800 irrigation meters in Town which currently pay the same rates
as single meters. In order to encourage conservation, a new rate structure for irrigation meters was evaluated

4.6% of the losses are associated with leaks in the distribution system. The remaining losses are anticipated to
be from paper losses associated with current estimating and tracking practices for authorized metered and
unmetered municipal uses, under-registering meters associated with older meters in the system, other
